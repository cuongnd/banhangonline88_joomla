# jQuery TubePlayer Plugin

A jQuery wrapper around the YouTube Player API.

The TubePlayer plugin allows developers to focus on functionality as opposed to infrastructure around the YouTube player. The plugin exposes meaningful methods that are triggered based on state changes from the player API. The plugin also provides events that can be triggered on it allowing developers to create a customized player remote, programmatically control videos, gain access for analytics purposes and much more.

jQuery("#player").tubeplayer("volume");
jQuery("#player").tubeplayer("volume",50); // 0-100

## Testing

### Unit Tests

The **test/** folder contains the unit test scripts. This is a good place to get an idea for what's going on. You can also get some insight into the things the plugin can do.

### TubePlayer Debug Console

The **test_console/** folder within this repository, contains a fully functional debug console for the tubeplayer project.  

The console enables the quick creation and destruction of a youtube player with UI controls to supplement the various specified inputs.  The console allows the user to invoke operations and observe the effects (e.g. onPlayerPlaying, onPlay), by printing each action being invoked on the TubePlayer plugin while going through them. Additionally, the console has the necessary links to follow up in API docs.

In order to use the console, you will need to run a web server. A simple example would be to use python's SimpleHTTPServer. Here is an example of how to create host one on port 8082, from your command line navigate to the appropriate directory you want to serve up and then:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8082
```

There is a bash script that will run the debug console from the root directory. Assuming $CWD is the root directory:

```bash
./scripts/server.sh
```

To access..

- the debug console, navigate to `http://localhost:8082/test_console/index.html`
- the unit tests, navigate to `http://localhost:8082/test/tubeplayer.html`
