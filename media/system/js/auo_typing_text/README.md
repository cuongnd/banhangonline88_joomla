jQuery Teletype Plugin
======================

Teletype is a jQuery plugin that types out text, and then optionally deletes it, replicating human interaction.

Additional options provide the ability to preserve the typed text, in a console / terminal format, pause during typing and delete characters.

An online demo can be found at <http://teletype.rocks>.

Installation
---
Via [bower](https://github.com/stvwhtly/jquery-teletype-plugin/blob/master/bower.json):
```bash
bower install jquery.teletype
```

Manual:

    <script src="jquery.js"></script>

	<script>
		$( function() {
			$( '.type-text' ).teletype( {
				text: [ 'one', 'two', 'three' ],
				typeDelay: 0,
				backDelay: 20
			} );
		} );

 callbackFinished     | `null` (function)                   | Callback function called once everything is finished. See `Callback functions` below.

Methods
-------

**teletype.setCursor(string cursor)**

Change the cursor value. Can be used at any time although particularly useful
when combined with callback functions.


Deleting characters `~`
---

It is possible to delete a defined number of characters then proceed with the rest of the text output. 

Use `~x` within the text string, where x is an integer value defining the characters to backspace.

Example, type "auti", delete 1 character and continue to type "o", resulting in the word "auto":

```
auti~1o^`
```

Pause / Delay `^`
---

Delay typing the next character using `^x` where x in an integer value of milliseconds to pause.

To pause for 2 seconds after typing the word "pause" before continuing to type: 

```
pause^2000 more
```

Line Breaks `\n`
---

Line breaks can be added using `\n`, which are converted to `<br />` during output.

Generated Markup
---

The following markup is used to output the teletype text.

```
<span class="teletype-prefix">[prefix]</span>
<span class="teletype-text">[string]</span>
<span class="teletype-cursor">[cursor]</span>
```
    
This provides the ability to customise the style of the output text in your CSS.

Callback functions
---

There are two callback functions available, `callbackNext` and `callbackType`.

**Using the `callbackNext` callback**

Called every time a new text item begins. Two parameters are passed back here,
`current` and `teletype`.

The `current` object holds details of the current text and position pointers.

```
current = { 
	string: '', 	// The full text line being written.
	index: 0, 		// Array index of the text array.
	position: 0, 	// Character index position within the current text string.
	loop: 0 		// Current loop number, increments if settings.loop is enabled.
};
```

The second parameter `teletype` returns the teletype object itself, allowing
you to easily interact with the teletyper.

Example, change the cursor when moving to the 3rd text item (index 2).

```
callbackNext: function( current, teletype ) {
	if ( current.index == 2 ) {
		teletype.setCursor( 'â–‹' );
	}
}
```

**Using the `callbackType` callback**

Callback function called every 'letter', when either typing or deleting output.

There are three parameters used here, `letter`, `current` and `teletype`.

The value of `letter` is the text that will be written, usually a single
character but can be HTML markup for special characters.

The other two parameters are the same as those used by `callbackNext` (see above).

```
callbackType: function( letter, current, teletype ) {
	if ( current.index == 2 && current.position == 13 ) {
		teletype.setCursor( '_' );
	}
}
```

**Using the `callbackFinished` callback**

Callback function called immediately once the teletype process is entirely finished.

The single parameter `teletype` returns the teletype object itself.

```
callbackFinished: function( teletype ) {
	alert( 'Nothing left to type!' );
}
```
